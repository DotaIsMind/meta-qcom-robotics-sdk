# Welcome to the Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics SDK (QIR SDK)

The Qualcomm® Intelligent Robotics(QIR) SDK is a collection of components that enable you to develop robotic features on Qualcomm platforms. This SDK is applicable to the Qualcomm Linux releases.

The QIR SDK provides the following:
- Reference code in Robot Operating System (ROS) packages to develop robotic applications.
- E2E(end-to-end) scenario samples to evaluate robotic platforms.
- Integrated cross-compile toolchain, which includes common build tools, such as aarch64-oe-linux-gcc, make, cmake, and ROS core.
- Tools and scripts to speed up the development.
- Provide some basic ROS nodes to help you build your ros application, such as qrb_ros_camera, qrb_ros_nn_inference,etc.

This will guide you through developing your first sample application. It explains how to:
- Flash the prebuilt Qualcomm linux image and configure the environment.
- Run sample applications.
- Develop sample applications using the prebuilt image and QIR SDK.
- Generate customized images and QIR SDK.
- Provides a Gazebo simulation environment for testing and debugging robotic applications.

This repository serves as a ​​layer in the QIR SDK build system​​, working in conjunction with other layers such as:
- [meta-qcom-robotics-distro](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics-distro.git) 
- [meta-qcom-robotics](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics.git) 

to collectively build the **QIR SDK**.

## Branches

**scarthgap**: Primary development branch. Contributors should develop submissions based on this branch, and submit pull requests to this branch.

## Quick build

Please refer to the [Yocto Project Reference Manual](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html)
to set up your Yocto Project build environment.

Please follow the instructions below for a KAS-based build. The KAS tool offers
an easy way to setup bitbake based projects. For more details, visit the
[KAS documentation](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

1. Install kas tool

    ```
    sudo pip3 install kas
    ```

2. Clone meta-qcom-robotics-sdk layer

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics-sdk.git -b main
    ```

3. Build using the KAS configuration for one of the supported boards

    ```
    kas build meta-qcom-robotics-sdk/ci/qcs6490-rb3gen2-core-kit-ros-jazzy-full-image.yml
    ```

For a manual build without KAS, refer to the [Yocto Project Quick Build](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html).
